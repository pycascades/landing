## Why We Need You

How did I get here? PyCascades upgraded my life\!

When it came nearish, my remote community (think 10+ hours \+ 🚢🚢🚢), I went from “just me” to “my people”, friends, mentors, and collaborators across borders.

### How? Sponsors are our critical dependency

*You’re not an optional package, you’re core infrastructure\!*

Our team works year-round to grow our community through two key aspects:. 

1️⃣ Travel Grants \- Covering costs for folks like past-me so no one misses out.

2️⃣  Hybrid Access \- Global streaming so everyone, snowed-in or oceans away, feels present. (Minus the stickers, sadly)

But venues, streaming, and “actual” coffee cost $$$. Your support bridges distances and builds community.

## Why Sponsors ❤️ Us

(Hint: It’s not just warm fuzzies 😻)

intro:

PyCascades is not PyCon US and that’s the point. 

PyCascades is where careers launch, friendships ignite, and “aha\!” moments happen; all over terrible coffee ☕ 😿(*Working on it\!*).
