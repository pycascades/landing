Hello PyCon attendees!

You are the lucky ones that heard about PyCascades 2025 first!! Donâ€™t you feel special?! ðŸ’œ

body:

Next year PyCascades is going to be in Portland, OR. Back at Revolution Hall.
Make sure you save *February 8th and 9th* to join us there for two days of fun
and learning. 

If youâ€™re interested in speaking our call for proposals opens August 11th. If
youâ€™re on the fence we offer proposal and speaker mentoring sessions starting in
July. If youâ€™d like to join us send an email to
[speaker-support@pycascades.com](mailto:speaker-support@pycascades.com).
Mentoring sessions do not commit you to submitting a proposal nor do they
guarantee a speaker spot, but theyâ€™ll be fun and informative. Canâ€™t wait to see
you all there!!  (Well maybe not all 3000 of you, but as many as Rev Hall can
hold.)
